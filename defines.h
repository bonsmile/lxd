/*
    Corrade's forward declaration for std::string
        — a lightweight alternative to the full <string> where supported
    https://doc.magnum.graphics/corrade/StlForwardString_8h.html
    This is a single-header library generated from the Corrade project. With
    the goal being easy integration, it's deliberately free of all comments
    to keep the file size small. More info, detailed changelogs and docs here:
